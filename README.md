# Simple C++ Calculator

A user-friendly console application that performs basic mathematical operations. This project demonstrates the use of `switch` statements for efficient menu-driven logic in C++.

## Supported Operations
* **Addition (+)**
* **Subtraction (-)**
* **Multiplication (*)**
* **Division (/)**
* **Modulus (%)**

## Logic Flow
The program captures a character as an input for the operator and uses a `switch` block to execute the corresponding mathematical formula.



## How to Run

### Using an IDE (Visual Studio / Dev-C++)
1. Create a new C++ project in your IDE.
2. Copy the code from `SimpleCalculator.cpp` into your project.
3. Press **F11** to compile and run.

### Using Command Line (GCC)
1. Compile: `g++ SimpleCalculator.cpp -o Calculator`
2. Run: `./Calculator`
